g.  lexErr1.txt - 'int' should be 'num' for an interger identifier, 'world.24' does
    not follow the rule for variable names, 'else' should be 'inst' for the else
    statement in an if block, 'Float' should be 'dec' for a float identifier and 
    it shouldn't be capitalized, '5.7.8' does not follow the rule for float literals
    due to the extra dot

    SynErr2.txt - program needs to begin with 'start', '==' after world1 is not an
    assignment character, the braces after 'given' should be replaced with 
    parenthesis, missing boolean character in the 'if' block between 'world1' and 
    '3', there needs to be a semicolon after 'world1 = 3 + 5' to complete
    the assigment statement
